### How to:

You can either create your own user account, or use the account provided below

#### `1. Creating your own account`

Create an account as normal and choose a plan on the profile screen.
Stripe is running in test mode, so a test credit card can be used:

Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242

Expiry date: any valid date (eg: 02/26)

CVV: any 3 digit number (eg: 123)
